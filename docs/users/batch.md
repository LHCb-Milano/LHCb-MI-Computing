# Batch system
The [HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/){:target="_blank"} job scheduler is installed and running in the machine.
You should be able to submit jobs following the official documentation.
This documentation is still not complete, if you use this system, please consider [contributing](https://github.com/LHCb-Milano/LHCb-MI-Computing). Thanks!
